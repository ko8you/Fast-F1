What's new in v3.1.0
--------------------

(released 29/08/2023)

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added additional circuit information that includes the location of corners,
  marshal lights, marshal sectors and the rotation of the track map. This
  data is available through :func:`fastf1.core.Session.get_circuit_info`. Also
  check out the new examples that show how to annotate your plots using this
  data.
  A huge thank you to @multiviewer (https://multiviewer.app/) for providing
  this information through MultiViewer's API.

- "SessionInfo" data from the F1 livetiming API is now available through
  :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.session_info`

- Added driver colors for Shwartzman and Lawson (by @pesaventofilippo) (#441)

- Various improvement to the ``Laps.pick_*`` methods to make it easier to select
  specific laps from :class:`~fastf1.core.Laps` (by @Casper-Guo) (#376).

  **New** (no equivalent has existed before)

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_not_deleted` for selecting all laps that
    haven't been deleted

  **New** (these methods replace methods that only accepted single values; the
  new functions accept single values or lists of values)

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_laps` for selecting one or multiple laps
    by their lap number; replaces :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_lap`

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_drivers` for selecting laps from one or
    multiple drivers; replaces :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_driver`

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_compounds` for selecting laps driven on one or
    multiple compounds; replaces :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_tyre`

  **Improved**

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_track_status` now has additional options for
    the ``how`` argument to exclude laps with a specific track status or match
    or exclude laps with one of multiple track status values.


Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

- greatly improved speed when parsing car data and position data


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.split_qualifying_sessions` returns
  incorrect result

- Fixed incorrect calculation of results for Qualifying-like sessions (#429)

- Fixed incorrect alignment of lap start/end times that causes shifted telemetry
  data when comparing laps and incorrect results for calculated grid positions
  (#440)

- Fixed an unhandled exception in the lap timing parser that made it impossible
  to load data for the 2020 Miami Qualifying (#431)

- Fixed incorrectly set lap start times after some red flag restarts

- Fixed a bug that could prevent data loading in case of partially missing data
